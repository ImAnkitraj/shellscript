# Bash shell script to find if a number is perfect or not

1. Write a bash script to find if a number is perfect or not. A perfect number is defined as, a positive number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. Smallest no is 6 ex= 1,2,3 are divisor of 6 and 1+2+3=6

---------------
Code:
---------------
# !/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number"

# reading input from user 
read no  

# initializing the value of i
i=1

ans=0

while [ $i -le $((no / 2)) ]   

do
       
        if [[ $((no%i)) -eq 0  ]] 
        then

                ans=$((ans + i))

fi

i = $((i + 1))

done

if [ $no -eq $ans ]  
then
        # printing output
        echo "$no is perfect" 
        else
        
        # printing output
        echo "$no is NOT perfect" 
fi

----------------
Output:
----------------
Enter a number
6
6 is perfect



2. Shell Script to Count Lines and Words in a File

Linux provides users a great cool feature of the command-line tool along with a graphical user interface where they can perform tasks via ruining command. All of this command returns a status according to their execution. Its execution value can be used for showing errors or take some other action in a shell script. 

There may be some scenarios where one needs to keep track of the number of lines and number of words in a particular file. In that scenario, any of the following methods can be used to count the number of the lines and the words in a particular file in Linux. 

-------------------------
Code:
-------------------------

#!/usr/bin/bash

# path to the file
file_path="/home/amninder/Desktop/demo.txt"

# using wc command to count number of lines
number_of_lines=`wc --lines < $file_path`

# using wc command to count number of words
number_of_words=`wc --word < $file_path`

# Displaying number of lines and number of words
echo "Number of lines: $number_of_lines"
echo "Number of words: $number_of_words"
